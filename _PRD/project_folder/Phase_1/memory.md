## Notes:

- Remember to handle TMDB API rate limits.
- Prioritize Turkish language data from TMDB.
- Ensure all UI text is translated into Turkish.
- The initial implementation uses `AsyncStorage` for storing user preferences. This will be migrated to Supabase in Phase 2.
- The app now uses real streaming service data from the TMDB API, with a focus on popular Turkish streaming services.
- The settings screen has been updated to filter and sort streaming services based on their availability in Turkey.
- The StreamingService interface has been updated to match the TMDB API response structure, using provider_id instead of id.
- Comprehensive error handling has been implemented for API requests and data processing to prevent runtime errors.
- The genres data is currently hardcoded - this should be fetched from the TMDB API and localized properly.
- Unit tests need to be implemented for all components and services.
- Always add null checks when accessing properties of objects that might be undefined, especially when working with API responses and user preferences.
- The theme context provides light and dark mode support with a system option that follows the device's theme.
- User preferences now include theme mode selection that persists across app restarts.
- The recommendations screen now supports sorting by IMDB rating, popularity, release date, and vote count.
- The streaming services are now properly ordered with the most popular services at the top.
- The sorting functionality in the recommendations screen allows toggling between ascending and descending order.
